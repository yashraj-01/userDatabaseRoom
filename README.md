# userDatabaseRoom

In this application I have shown the implementation of Room DB as it is a better alternative to SQLite DB. Here I have also preferred to go with the fragment approach rather than several activities as it significantly improves the prformance of the application.
When you open the app you will be asked to authorize as an admin with username: admin and password: admin123456. Then there is a list view showing all the current users.
Here, you can add and remove a user. You can also remove all the users at once from the options menu.
